## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques for regression tasks. The dataset used in this project is pre-processed with Pandas, and the models are built using scikit-learn. The project includes:
- Data loading and pre-processing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training with different regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Model evaluation using common metrics such as RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
